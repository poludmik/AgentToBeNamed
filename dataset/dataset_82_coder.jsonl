Create a pie plot using the sorted grouped DataFrame, where the 'Faculty Name' values are used as labels and the sum of international students are used as the sizes of the pie slices.\n5. Set the faculty names as the legend of the pie plot.\n6. Save the pie plot to 'plots/faculties_tech_uni802.png'.\n\nApproach each task from the list in isolation, advancing to the next only upon its successful resolution. \nStrictly follow to the prescribed instructions to avoid oversights and ensure an accurate solution.\nYou must include the neccessery import statements at the top of the code.\nYou must not include `plt.show()`. Just save the plot the way it is stated in the tasks.\nYou must include print statements to output the final result of your code.\nYou must use the backticks to enclose the code.\n\nExample of the output format:\n```python\n\n```", "plan": "1.
